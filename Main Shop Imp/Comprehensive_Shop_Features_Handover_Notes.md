### ⚠️ Known Checkout Issues

#### Critical Issue: Product Image Shape Mismatch

**Problem:** TypeError in checkout API when product objects have mismatched image field structures.

**Root Cause:**

- Database stores `images: string[]` (array)
- Some fallback logic expects `image: string` (singular)
- Code tries to access `product.images[0]` on objects that only have `image`

**Error Message:**

```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '0')
at /api/checkout line 107: image: product.images[0] || ''
```

**Impact:** Checkout fails for certain product configurations

**Status:** ⚠️ **IDENTIFIED - NEEDS FIX**

**Recommended Fix:**

```typescript
// Safe image access pattern
const getProductImage = (product: any): string => {
  if (Array.isArray(product.images) && product.images.length > 0) {
    return product.images[0];
  }
  if (typeof product.image === "string") {
    return product.image;
  }
  return "/images/fallback.jpg";
};

// Usage in checkout
orderItems.push({
  // ... other fields
  image: getProductImage(product),
});
```

#### Secondary Issues

1. **Mock Route Conflicts**
   - Mock checkout routes can interfere with real checkout
   - Environment-based route switching needed

2. **Stripe Configuration Validation**
   - API keys validation could be more robust
   - Better error messages for configuration issues

3. **Stock Validation Race Conditions**
   - Potential race condition between cart and checkout stock validation
   - Consider implementing stock reservation

ON products(created_at DESC);

-- Filter optimization
CREATE INDEX idx_products_category_filter
ON products(category) WHERE active = true;

CREATE INDEX idx_products_brand_filter
ON products(brand) WHERE active = true;

-- Text search optimization
CREATE INDEX idx_products_title_trgm
ON products USING gin (title gin_trgm_ops);

CREATE INDEX idx_products_short_description_trgm
ON products USING gin (short_description gin_trgm_ops);
