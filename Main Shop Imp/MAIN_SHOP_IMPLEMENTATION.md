# Main Shop Implementation Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-07  
**Project:** vo-onelink-google  
**Status:** âœ… Complete - Ready for Testing

---

## What Was Built

A new **read-only Main Shop** catalog that aggregates products from all influencer shops without touching any existing onboarding/dashboard code or making any database changes.

---

## Files Created

### 1. Server-Side Admin Client
- **Path:** `lib/supabase-admin.ts`
- **Purpose:** Server-only Supabase client using service role key
- **Security:** Never exposed to browser, only used in server components and API routes

### 2. Read-Only Feed API
- **Path:** `app/api/main-shop/feed/route.ts`
- **Purpose:** Aggregates products from `influencer_shop_products` table
- **Features:**
  - Deduplicates products
  - Filters by active, in_stock, and stock_count > 0
  - Sorts by newest first
  - Supports limit query parameter (default 48, max 96)
  - Force dynamic to prevent caching

### 3. Main Shop Page (Server Component)
- **Path:** `app/main-shop/page.tsx`
- **Purpose:** Displays product grid
- **Features:**
  - SSR with no revalidation (always fresh)
  - Empty state when no products
  - Product cards with image, title, price
  - Links to product detail pages

### 4. Loading State
- **Path:** `app/main-shop/loading.tsx`
- **Purpose:** Skeleton UI while page loads
- **Features:** 9 animated skeleton cards

### 5. Product Detail Page (PDP)
- **Path:** `app/product/[id]/page.tsx`
- **Purpose:** Shows individual product details
- **Features:**
  - Two-column layout (image + details)
  - Displays: title, price, description, stock status
  - Fallback for missing images

---

## Files Modified

### 1. Shop Router
- **Path:** `app/shop/page.tsx`
- **Change:** Added feature flag logic
- **Behavior:**
  - If `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_MAIN_SHOP=true` â†’ redirects to `/main-shop`
  - Otherwise â†’ redirects to `/shops` (current behavior)

### 2. Middleware
- **Path:** `middleware.ts`
- **Changes:**
  - Added `/main-shop` to public routes
  - Added `/product` to public routes
  - Added `/api/main-shop` to public API routes
- **Security:** These are GET-only read operations, safe for public access

### 3. Environment Variables
- **Path:** `.env.local`
- **Added:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_MAIN_SHOP=false`
- **Purpose:** Feature flag to control `/shop` routing

---

## Guardrails Respected âœ…

1. âœ… **No database writes** - All operations are read-only
2. âœ… **No migrations or seeds** - Uses existing tables as-is
3. âœ… **No onboarding/dashboard changes** - All new files in separate directories
4. âœ… **Service role key server-side only** - Never exposed to browser
5. âœ… **Freeze mode compatible** - New API is GET-only, allowed by middleware
6. âœ… **No mock/demo data** - Reads real data from database
7. âœ… **Influencer routes unchanged** - `/shops` and `/shop/[handle]` untouched

---

## How to Test

### 1. Start Development Server
```powershell
# Clean build
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .next, .turbo -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
pnpm dev
```

### 2. Test with Flag OFF (Current Behavior)
```powershell
# Ensure flag is false in .env.local
# NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_MAIN_SHOP=false
```

**Expected Results:**
- âœ… `http://localhost:3000/shops` â†’ Works (influencer directory)
- âœ… `http://localhost:3000/shop/style-forward` â†’ Works (influencer shop)
- âœ… `http://localhost:3000/shop` â†’ Redirects to `/shops`
- âœ… `http://localhost:3000/main-shop` â†’ Shows product grid or empty state
- âœ… `http://localhost:3000/product/<uuid>` â†’ Shows product details

### 3. Test API Directly
```powershell
# Get products feed
curl -sS http://localhost:3000/api/main-shop/feed | ConvertFrom-Json

# With limit
curl -sS "http://localhost:3000/api/main-shop/feed?limit=12" | ConvertFrom-Json
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "...",
      "title": "...",
      "price": 99.99,
      "primary_image": "...",
      "active": true,
      "in_stock": true,
      "stock_count": 10,
      "created_at": "..."
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4. Test with Flag ON (New Behavior)
```powershell
# Edit .env.local
# NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_MAIN_SHOP=true

# Restart server
pnpm dev
```

**Expected Results:**
- âœ… `http://localhost:3000/shop` â†’ Redirects to `/main-shop`
- âœ… All other routes work as before

### 5. Verify No Writes
- Check browser Network tab: all requests should be GET only
- No POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE requests should occur
- Service role key should NOT appear in any client-side code

---

## Rollback Plan

If anything breaks:

1. **Disable Feature Flag**
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_MAIN_SHOP=false
   ```
   This restores `/shop â†’ /shops` behavior immediately.

2. **Remove Files (Optional)**
   ```powershell
   # These can be removed without affecting existing features
   Remove-Item -Recurse app/main-shop
   Remove-Item -Recurse app/product
   Remove-Item -Recurse app/api/main-shop
   Remove-Item lib/supabase-admin.ts
   ```

3. **Revert Middleware Changes**
   - Remove `/main-shop`, `/product`, `/api/main-shop` from public routes

---

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### Phase 2 - Filtering & Search
- Add category filter to feed API
- Add price range filter
- Add search by title
- Add sort options (price, date, popularity)

### Phase 3 - Pagination
- Add page/offset support to handle large catalogs
- Add "Load More" button or infinite scroll

### Phase 4 - UI Enhancements
- Add product badges (New, Sale, Low Stock)
- Add quick view modal
- Add product comparison
- Add wishlist feature

### Phase 5 - Performance
- Add Redis caching for feed API
- Implement ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)
- Add telemetry and monitoring

---

## Technical Notes

### Database Query
The feed API uses this query:
```sql
SELECT 
  products.*
FROM influencer_shop_products
INNER JOIN products ON influencer_shop_products.product_id = products.id
WHERE products.active = true
  AND products.in_stock = true
  AND products.stock_count > 0
```

### Deduplication
Products are deduplicated by ID using a Set, so if multiple influencers link the same product, it only appears once.

### SSR vs Client
- Main shop page: Server component (SSR)
- Product page: Server component (SSR)
- Feed API: Server route
- All compatible with Google Translate/i18n

### Performance Considerations
- Current limit: 48 products (configurable up to 96)
- No caching to ensure fresh data
- Consider adding ISR if product count grows large

---

## Security Checklist

- âœ… Service role key only in server-side code
- âœ… No user authentication required (public catalog)
- âœ… No write operations exposed
- âœ… Input validation on limit parameter
- âœ… Middleware allows GET-only access
- âœ… RLS policies respected (service role bypasses, but we only read public data)

---

## Freeze Mode Compatibility

This implementation is **100% compatible** with Core Freeze mode:
- All new routes are read-only
- No writes to onboarding/dashboard areas
- New API endpoint is GET-only
- Middleware explicitly allows `/api/main-shop` for GET requests

---

## Questions or Issues?

If you encounter any problems:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check server logs for API errors
3. Verify environment variables are set correctly
4. Ensure database has products with `published=true` links
5. Try the API endpoint directly with curl to isolate issues
