# 🔧 CRITICAL FIX: Auth Cookie Issue - FINAL SOLUTION

## 📌 Problem Summary

**Test Failure:** All 3 E2E onboarding tests timeout waiting for `/auth/onboarding` URL
**Root Cause:** Sign-up API creates session server-side but **auth cookies never reach the browser**
**Result:** Middleware treats user as unauthenticated and redirects `/auth/onboarding` → `/sign-up`

---

## 🔍 Technical Analysis

### **What Was Wrong:**

**File:** `app/api/auth/sign-up/route.ts` (lines 132-141)

```typescript
// ❌ BROKEN: Uses request cookies (read-only)
const supabase = await createServerSupabaseClient(request)
const { error: signInError } = await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({ email, password })
```

**Why it failed:**
1. `createServerSupabaseClient(request)` creates a client with **read-only cookies** (see `lib/supabase/server.ts:18-30`)
2. The `setAll()` method is a no-op when using `NextRequest`
3. `signInWithPassword()` creates a session but **cannot write cookies** to the response
4. Browser never receives auth cookies
5. Middleware blocks access to protected routes

### **Evidence from Tests:**
- URL stays at `/sign-up` for full 30 seconds
- Even forced `page.goto("/auth/onboarding")` redirects back to `/sign-up`
- Middleware logs show: "no session" → redirect to sign-in

---

## ✅ THE FIX (Applied)

### **Changes Made:**

**1. Added import (line 7):**
```typescript
import { cookies as nextCookies } from "next/headers"
```

**2. Replaced auth logic (lines 136-157):**
```typescript
// ✅ FIXED: Use cookies() to create writable cookie store
const cookieStore = await nextCookies()
const supabase = await createServerSupabaseClient({ cookies: cookieStore })

const { data: sessionData, error: signInError } = await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({ 
  email, 
  password 
})

if (signInError || !sessionData.session) {
  console.warn('Sign-in after sign-up failed; user must sign in manually:', signInError)
  return NextResponse.json(
    createAuthSuccessResponse(user, "Account created! Please sign in to continue.")
  )
}

console.log('User signed in and session cookies set after sign-up')

return NextResponse.json(
  createAuthSuccessResponse(user, "Account created successfully! ")
)
```

### **Why This Works:**

1. ✅ `nextCookies()` returns Next.js App Router cookie store
2. ✅ `createServerSupabaseClient({ cookies: cookieStore })` creates client with **writable cookies**
3. ✅ `signInWithPassword()` now **sets auth cookies** via `cookieStore.set()`
4. ✅ Browser receives `Set-Cookie` headers in HTTP response
5. ✅ Middleware sees authenticated session
6. ✅ Navigation to `/auth/onboarding` succeeds

---

## 🧪 How to Test

### **Run E2E Tests:**
```bash
npx playwright test tests/e2e/onboarding/submit-and-redirect.spec.ts --headed
```

### **Expected Results:**
```
✓ influencer onboarding completes and redirects correctly (30-45s)
✓ brand/supplier onboarding completes and redirects correctly (30-45s)
✓ onboarding submit blocked without required documents (30-45s)

3 passed (2m)
```

### **Manual Test:**
1. Go to `/sign-up`
2. Fill form and create account
3. **Should now redirect to:** `/auth/onboarding?role=...` ✅
4. Browser DevTools → Application → Cookies:
   - Should see `sb-*-auth-token` cookies ✅
5. Complete onboarding flow
6. Verify redirect to correct dashboard ✅

## 🎯 What This Fixes

### **Before (Broken):**
```
1. User signs up → API creates user ✅
2. API calls signInWithPassword → Session created server-side ✅
3. Cookies NOT set in response ❌
4. Browser has no auth cookies ❌
5. User tries to go to /auth/onboarding ❌
6. Middleware sees no session → redirects to /sign-up ❌
7. Test timeouts waiting for /auth/onboarding ❌
```

### **After (Fixed):**
```
1. User signs up → API creates user ✅
2. API calls signInWithPassword with writable cookies ✅
3. Set-Cookie headers added to response ✅
4. Browser receives auth cookies ✅
5. User navigates to /auth/onboarding ✅
6. Middleware sees valid session → allows access ✅
7. Test proceeds successfully ✅
```

## 📚 Reference: Cookie Handling in Next.js App Router

### **Read-Only (Request cookies):**
```typescript
// ❌ Cannot set cookies
const supabase = await createServerSupabaseClient(request)
```

### **Writable (App Router cookies):**
```typescript
// ✅ Can set cookies
import { cookies } from "next/headers"
const cookieStore = await cookies()
const supabase = await createServerSupabaseClient({ cookies: cookieStore })
```

### **Key Difference:**
- **Request cookies:** For reading existing cookies (middleware, GET requests)
- **App Router cookies:** For setting new cookies (sign-in, sign-up, auth changes)

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### **Immediate:**
1. ✅ Verify `git diff` shows the fix
2. ✅ Run E2E tests
3. ✅ All tests should pass now

### **If Tests Pass:**
```bash
git add app/api/auth/sign-up/route.ts
git commit -m "fix: set auth cookies in sign-up response

- Use nextCookies() to create writable cookie store
- Ensures signInWithPassword sets cookies on HTTP response
- Fixes middleware blocking unauthenticated access to /auth/onboarding
- E2E tests now pass successfully

Fixes: Auth cookie not being set after sign-up"

git push origin your-branch
```

### **If Tests Still Fail:**
1. Check browser DevTools → Application → Cookies
2. Verify `sb-*-auth-token` cookies are present
3. Check middleware logs for session detection
4. Review Playwright HTML report for new errors

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

### **E2E Tests:**
- ✅ All 3 tests pass
- ✅ No URL timeout errors
- ✅ Correct redirects to onboarding and dashboards

### **Browser Behavior:**
- ✅ Sign-up sets auth cookies
- ✅ Navigation to `/auth/onboarding` works
- ✅ Middleware allows authenticated access
- ✅ No redirect loops

### **Manual Testing:**
- ✅ Sign up → immediate redirect to onboarding
- ✅ Complete onboarding → redirect to dashboard
- ✅ Cookies visible in DevTools
- ✅ Re-entry guard prevents onboarding access

---

## 📝 Additional Context

### **Why This Wasn't Obvious:**
- Next.js App Router has two cookie APIs: `request.cookies` (read-only) and `cookies()` (writable)
- The helper function `createServerSupabaseClient()` accepts both but behaves differently
- Error was silent - session created but cookies not transmitted
- Middleware redirect masked the real issue

### **Best Practice:**
Always use `cookies()` from `next/headers` when you need to SET cookies in route handlers:
```typescript
import { cookies } from "next/headers"

const cookieStore = await cookies()
const supabase = await createServerSupabaseClient({ cookies: cookieStore })
// Now signInWithPassword, signUp, etc. will set cookies
```

**Status:** ✅ Critical auth cookie fix applied  
**Expected:** All E2E tests should now pass
