# Handover Report & Proposed Fix Plan

**Date:** September 25, 2025
**Status:** All diagnostics complete. Awaiting approval to begin fixes.

### **1. Executive Summary**

After a thorough investigation and a series of targeted SQL tests, we have confirmed that the critical issues facing the application (image display failures, 404 errors, and checkout failures) are **not caused by database corruption or misconfiguration**. The database itself is healthy, and the data is consistent.

The root causes are located entirely within the **application-level code** and stem from three distinct logical flaws:

1.  A hardcoded data override in the main shop page.
2.  A fragile data-fetching pattern in the influencer shop pages.
3.  Unsafe data handling in the checkout API route.

This report details each issue and presents a clear, step-by-step plan to resolve them.

### **2. Database Analysis & Key Insights**

- **Overall Health:** **Excellent.** The database passed all data consistency and integrity checks. There are no duplicate SKUs or titles, and financial data for products is valid.
- **Schema Discovery:** The diagnostic process revealed the exact schema for key tables:
    - `shops` links to users via `influencer_id`.
    - `influencer_shop_products` links products to influencers via `influencer_id` and `product_id`.
    - `profiles` links to users via its primary key, `id`.
- **Row Level Security (RLS) Policy:** **Working as intended.** Our RLS simulation test confirmed that the policies correctly allow authenticated users to read data from the `products` table. RLS is not the cause of any of the current issues.
- **Identified Data Integrity Issue:** While not a cause of the critical bugs, we found that most shops have a `null` `influencer_handle`. This is because the `influencer_id` in the `shops` table does not have a corresponding entry in the `profiles` table. This should be cleaned up later to ensure all shops have valid owner profiles.

#### **Key IDs & Profiles for Reference:**
- **Test Influencer ID:** `a768566a-2a0c-4eb6-8041-240ddba06f1d` (Owner of 'Style Forward')
- **Test Shop Handle:** `style-forward`
- **Test Supplier ID:** `04801774-40ba-47d8-9b27-858e84aae0f9` ('Admin User')

### **3. Root Cause of Critical Issues**

#### **Issue #1: Product Images Not Displaying in Main Shop**
- **Root Cause:** The component `app/shop/enhanced-page-fixed.tsx` contains a hardcoded map of product titles to Unsplash URLs. The code prioritizes this map over the actual image URLs fetched from the database. Since the titles of most products in the database (e.g., "Premium Headphones") do not exist in this map, the component's fallback logic fails, resulting in no image being displayed.

#### **Issue #2: 404 Errors on Influencer Shop Pages**
- **Root Cause:** The page component `app/shop/[handle]/page.tsx` attempts to fetch its own data via a server-side network request to `/api/shop/[handle]`. The logic to construct the URL for this request is fragile and fails in the local development environment. When the data fetch fails, the component programmatically triggers a `notFound()` response, rendering the 404 page. Our final SQL test proved that the data for the 'style-forward' shop exists and is queryable in the database.

#### **Issue #3: Checkout Failures**
- **Root Cause:** The API route `app/api/checkout/route.ts` contains unsafe fallback logic. If a product from the user's cart is not found in the database, the code creates a temporary "fallback" product object. This object has a different data structure than a real product object. Later in the code, an attempt to access a property that only exists on the real object (`product.images`) causes a `TypeError`, which crashes the process inside a generic `try...catch` block, leading to a silent 500 error.

### **4. Proposed Fix Plan & Methodology**

I will address these issues sequentially, from simplest to most complex, ensuring the application becomes progressively more stable with each step.

**Step 1: Fix the Image Display Issue (Low Risk)**
- **File to Edit:** `app/shop/enhanced-page-fixed.tsx`
- **Method:** I will remove the entire hardcoded `productImages` map. I will then adjust the `transformProduct` function to **always** use the `images` array provided from the database. This will ensure that the real product images are always passed to the product card component.

**Step 2: Fix the Influencer Shop 404s (Medium Risk)**
- **File to Edit:** `app/shop/[handle]/page.tsx`
- **Method:** I will refactor the page to eliminate the fragile server-side `fetch`. I will move the data-fetching logic from the `/api/shop/[handle]` route directly into the `InfluencerShopPage` component. This is a more robust, modern Next.js pattern that allows the page to query the database directly and securely without making a network request to itself.

**Step 3: Fix the Checkout Failures (Medium Risk)**
- **File to Edit:** `app/api/checkout/route.ts`
- **Method:** I will make the checkout process more robust and less error-prone. I will remove the unsafe "product not found" fallback logic. Instead, if any product in the cart cannot be verified against the database, the API will reject the entire checkout request with a clear error message (e.g., "Product 'XYZ' is no longer available"). This fail-fast approach prevents runtime errors and provides a better user experience.
