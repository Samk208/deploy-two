# Comprehensive Issue Analysis - September 25, 2025

This document provides a detailed root cause analysis of the critical issues affecting the `vo-onelink-google` project. As requested, no code has been modified. The focus is on documenting the underlying causes of the observed bugs.

## 1. Image Display Problems

**Symptom:** Product images do not appear in the main shop's grid or list views but display correctly in the "Quick View" modal.

**Root Cause:** The issue stems from a hardcoded data override within the main shop page component, `app/shop/enhanced-page-fixed.tsx`.

- **Hardcoded Image Map:** The component contains a large JavaScript object (`productImages`) that maps specific product titles to a predefined list of Unsplash image URLs.
- **Flawed Data Transformation:** A `transformProduct` function is used to process every product fetched from the database. This function prioritizes the hardcoded Unsplash URLs. It only attempts to use the actual Supabase image URL (`product.images`) if the product's title is **not** found in the hardcoded map.

**Conclusion:** The images fail to display because the product cards are being fed incorrect or non-existent image URLs due to this development-time data override. The Quick View modal works because it likely uses the raw, untransformed product data, which contains the correct Supabase image URLs.

## 2. Shop Display Problems (404 Errors)

**Symptom:** Navigating to an influencer's shop page (e.g., `/shop/style-forward`) results in a 404 "This page could not be found" error.

**Root Cause:** The error is not a true 404. It is programmatically triggered by a data-fetching failure within the `app/shop/[handle]/page.tsx` Server Component.

- **Unreliable Server-Side Fetch:** The page attempts to fetch its own data by making a network request to its corresponding API route (`/api/shop/[handle]`). To do this, it uses a complex and fragile logic to construct an absolute URL for the `fetch` call.
- **Failure Scenario:** In a local development environment, this URL construction logic fails to resolve to the correct address (e.g., `http://localhost:3001`). The `fetch` call consequently fails.
- **Programmatic `notFound()`:** When the data fetch returns `null` due to the network error, the component's logic explicitly calls Next.js's `notFound()` function, which is responsible for rendering the 404 page.

**Conclusion:** The page exists, but its internal data dependency is broken. The attempt to have the server component call itself over the network, combined with unreliable URL resolution, is the direct cause of the failure.

## 3. Checkout & Payment Failures

**Symptom:** The checkout process cannot be completed. Adding a credit card does not work, and the payment fails.

**Root Cause:** The checkout failure is caused by a fatal server-side runtime error within the `/api/checkout` route, which occurs before the Stripe API is ever called.

- **The `TypeError` time bomb:** The API route contains fallback logic to handle cases where a product ID from the cart is not found in the database. When this happens, it creates a new, temporary `product` object.
- **Data Shape Mismatch:** This temporary product object has a different structure (or "shape") than a real product object fetched from the database. Specifically, it has an `image` (singular) property, whereas the real object has an `images` (plural) property.
- **The Crash:** Later in the code, a different section attempts to access `product.images[0]`. This works for real products but throws a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '0')` when it encounters one of the temporary fallback objects, as `product.images` is undefined on them.
- **Silent Failure:** This `TypeError` is caught by a generic `try...catch` block, which logs a vague error to the console and returns a generic 500 Internal Server Error to the user, causing the checkout to fail without a clear explanation.

**Conclusion:** The checkout is not failing because of Stripe keys or configuration. It is failing because of a critical logic error in the server-side code that does not correctly handle data inconsistencies, leading to a fatal runtime exception that aborts the process. The complex fallback and influencer attribution logic significantly increase the risk of such errors.
