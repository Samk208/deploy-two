# Shop Fix Handover Report (2025-09-30)

- `tests/e2e/checkout.spec.ts` (follow-up)

# What was fixed

- **[Image container collapse in flex layouts]**
  - Root cause: `next/image` with `fill` inside a flex column where the parent container had no explicit height; with default `flex-shrink: 1`, the image container could collapse to a too-small height, so Playwright reported the `<img>` as hidden.
  - Change applied in `EnhancedProductCard` image container:
    - Added `shrink-0` to prevent flex shrinking.
    - Added `min-h-40 md:min-h-56` to guarantee visible minimum height.
    - Kept `relative`, `aspect-[4/3]`, `overflow-hidden`, `w-full` to satisfy Next.js `fill` requirements and maintain layout.
  - The `<Image>` remains `fill` with `className="object-cover"` and responsive `sizes`.

Code snippet reference (container class):
- Before: `"relative overflow-hidden bg-gray-100 w-full aspect-[4/3]"`
- After:  `"relative overflow-hidden bg-gray-100 w-full aspect-[4/3] shrink-0 min-h-40 md:min-h-56"`

# Why it fixes the issue

- **[Flexbox guard]** `shrink-0` sets `flex-shrink: 0`, preventing the image container from collapsing when siblings compete for height.
- **[Visibility safety]** `min-h-40` ensures a non-zero height even under constrained layouts (list view, tighter grids).
- **[Next.js Image contract]** `fill` requires a positioned parent with explicit dimensions; `relative` + `aspect-[4/3]` provide those dimensions.
- **[Visual fidelity]** `object-cover` ensures the image fills the box while preserving aspect ratio.

# Guardrails and best practices

- **[Always size the parent]** When using `next/image` with `fill`, the parent must have `position: relative` and an explicit height (via `height`, `aspect-ratio`, or a min-height fallback).
- **[Flex containers]** When the image wrapper is inside a flex column, add `shrink-0` and a `min-h-*`. Consider `min-w-0` on flex items where needed to avoid unexpected overflow.
- **[Fallbacks]** Keep a local placeholder image for network errors (`onError` toggles to `/placeholder.jpg`).
- **[Test hooks]** Ensure product cards have `data-testid="product-card"` so tests can assert visibility.
- **[Shop headers]** For shops missing banner/avatar (per `diagnose-images.txt`), add default fallbacks (e.g., initials for avatar) to avoid blank areas.

# Remaining/Related work

- **[Influencer shop product rendering]**
  - Ensure influencer handles used by tests are linked to products via `influencer_shop_products` and that filters (active/published/stock) allow visibility.
  - Verify `/shop/[handle]` renders `data-testid="product-card"` elements.

- **[Checkout configuration]**
  - Confirm `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, and `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` are present in `.env.local`.
  - Improve `app/api/checkout/route.ts` to return `400` with a descriptive message if keys are missing instead of generic `500`.

# Next Playwright tests to run

- **[Visuals: validate image visibility and height]**
  - `tests/e2e/shop-visual.spec.ts`
  - Expected: images inside `product-card` are visible; list view height > 60px.

- **[Influencer shop page]**
  - `tests/e2e/influencer-shop-page.spec.ts`
  - Expected: at least one `product-card` visible for a seeded handle; first image visible.

- **[Checkout (after keys verified)]**
  - `tests/e2e/checkout.spec.ts`
  - Expected: `res.ok()` true and a checkout session ID in the response.

# Suggested commands (PowerShell)

- Run shop visual tests (default config, or replace with your local override):
```powershell
pnpm exec playwright test tests/e2e/shop-visual.spec.ts
```

- Run influencer shop page tests:
```powershell
pnpm exec playwright test tests/e2e/influencer-shop-page.spec.ts
```

- After Stripe keys verified, run checkout tests and diagnostics:
```powershell
pnpm run diagnose:checkout | Tee-Object -FilePath "test-results\checkout-reports\diagnose-checkout.txt"
pnpm exec playwright test tests/e2e/checkout.spec.ts --reporter=list --reporter=json="test-results\checkout-reports\results.json" --reporter=html="test-results\checkout-reports\playwright-report" --output="test-results\checkout-reports\playwright-artifacts"
```
