### Sample image URLs from the codebase and match status
- Unsplash (used by seed/mapping) → matches config

```
- Supabase public Storage URL (constructed by getPublicUrl) → matches config
```81:83:lib/storage.ts
  const { data } = await supabase.storage.from("product-images").getPublicUrl(filePath)

  return data.publicUrl
```
Example shape (derived from the code above and bucket/path):
- https://<YOUR_SUPABASE_HOST>/storage/v1/object/public/product-images/products/<productId-timestamp>.<ext>
- https://<YOUR_SUPABASE_HOST>/storage/v1/object/public/brand-logos/public/<brandId>.<ext>
These match pathname /storage/v1/object/public/** allowed in config.

- Supabase signed Storage URLs (used for KYC/digital assets) → do NOT match config
```144:153:lib/storage.ts
export async function getVerificationDocumentUrl(supabase: SupabaseClient, filePath: string): Promise<string> {
  const { data, error } = await supabase.storage
    .from("verification-documents")
    .createSignedUrl(filePath, 900) // 900 seconds = 15 minutes
```
```181:190:lib/storage.ts
export async function getDigitalProductDownloadUrl(supabase: SupabaseClient, filePath: string): Promise<string> {
  const { data, error } = await supabase.storage
    .from("digital-assets")
    .createSignedUrl(filePath, 3600) // 1 hour expiration
```
Example shape:
- https://<YOUR_SUPABASE_HOST>/storage/v1/object/sign/<bucket>/<path>?token=...
These use /storage/v1/object/sign/** which is NOT included in remotePatterns.

### Yes/No: Would Next.js accept and optimize these URLs?
- Unsplash (images.unsplash.com): Yes (explicitly allowed).
- Supabase public Storage (/storage/v1/object/public/** on your SUPABASE_HOST): Yes (when NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL is set so SUPABASE_HOST resolves).
- Supabase signed Storage (/storage/v1/object/sign/**): No (not allowed by current pathname filter; would be rejected by next/image).

- If you intend to render signed Storage URLs with next/image, you’d need to add a remotePatterns entry for pathname /storage/v1/object/sign/** on the same SUPABASE_HOST.

I'll check the Next.js image configuration and search the codebase for Supabase Storage URL usage and any signed/dynamic URL generation in parallel. Then I’ll cite the exact config lines and sample URLs to confirm whether Next.js will accept/optimize them.

I’m going to open the image storage helper and related docs to extract real sample URL patterns, and search for any signed URL usage to compare against the Next.js image remotePatterns.

I'll extract the Next.js image config snippet with line numbers, then find real Supabase Storage URLs used or constructed in the codebase (public and signed) to check against the config.

### 1) Run locally and open target pages
- Commands
  - pnpm install
  - pnpm dev
- Pages to open in separate tabs
  - Shop grid: http://localhost:3000/shop
  - Influencer shops index: http://localhost:3000/shops → click any “Visit Shop” to open /shop/[handle]. If none, try a known handle like http://localhost:3000/shop/influencer-shop
  - Checkout: from a product card, Add to cart → go to http://localhost:3000/checkout → click the button that starts checkout (triggers POST /api/checkout)

### 2) What to watch (console/network) to confirm each hypothesis
- Image override masking Supabase URLs (shop grid)
  - In DevTools Network on /shop, filter: Img or “/_next/image”
    - Check the “Request URL” param “url=…” for each product image.
    - Confirm domains:
      - If images are from `images.unsplash.com` or `picsum.photos`, that indicates the override mapping.
      - If images are from your Supabase host with `/storage/v1/object/public/...`, that indicates DB-sourced images.
  - On an influencer shop page (/shop/[handle]), repeat:
    - Expect `product.image` from API; domain should be Supabase or a placeholder if DB empty.
- Server component self-fetch causing fake 404
  - Watch the terminal running pnpm dev:
    - Look for fetch logs to `/api/shop/[handle]` and their HTTP status (Next dev logs fetches.fullUrl are enabled).
    - If server shows 404/500 for the API fetch and the page navigates to a 404, that supports “self-fetch → 404”.
  - In browser:
    - Manually open the same API URL in a new tab: http://localhost:3000/api/shop/[handle]
      - If this returns 200 JSON while the page still 404s, that’s strong evidence of a self-fetch/baseUrl issue.
- Checkout product shape mismatch
  - In DevTools Network on /checkout, start checkout (POST /api/checkout):
    - Inspect Request Payload → items[]. Check for:
      - images present and is an array vs image string
      - presence of productId, title, price, quantity
    - Inspect Response:
      - 4xx/5xx with messages mentioning images or TypeError on `images[0]` indicates mismatch.
  - Also watch server terminal for stack traces referencing images or undefined indexing.

### 3) What to capture (confirm vs falsify)
- Image override masking Supabase URLs
  - Confirm: screenshot Network entry for a grid image showing `/_next/image?...url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.unsplash.com...` on /shop; and for /shop/[handle], a grid image showing Supabase or placeholder domain.
  - Falsify: screenshot showing Supabase `/storage/v1/object/public/...` used on /shop grid for multiple products.
- Server component self-fetch causing fake 404
  - Confirm: terminal screenshot with server fetch to `/api/shop/[handle]` → 404/500, plus browser tab of `GET /api/shop/[handle]` returning 200 JSON.
  - Falsify: both server fetch and direct GET return the same status (e.g., both 200 or both 404 with clear “not found”).
- Checkout product shape mismatch
  - Confirm: Network screenshot of `POST /api/checkout` payload where `items[].images` is missing or a string, and a 4xx/5xx response or terminal error referencing images/indexing.
  - Falsify: payload shows `items[].images` as non-empty string[] and the response is 200 with a created session.
