## Overview

This repository will stay in sync with your deployed chats on [v0.app](https://v0.app).
Any changes you make to your deployed app will be automatically pushed to this repository from [v0.app](https://v0.app).

## Deployment

**[https://v0.app/chat/projects/UPdyAsLaHYm](https://v0.app/chat/projects/UPdyAsLaHYm)**

## How It Works

1. Create and modify your project using [v0.app](https://v0.app)
2. Deploy your chats from the v0 interface
3. Changes are automatically pushed to this repository
4. Vercel deploys the latest version from this repository

## Security and Test Credentials

Sensitive test user credentials were removed from the repository and rotated.

- Test credentials are now available only via secure stores (1Password or CI secrets)
- For local development, use environment variables defined in `env.example`
- If you need seed users, run your teamâ€™s seeding script (see `My test users/README.md` for details)

Important:

- Supabase keys and any leaked credentials were rotated. Pull updated secrets before testing.
