# Export Debug Report

- [x] Export modal component location
  - `app/dashboard/supplier/products/components/ExportProductsDrawer.tsx`
  - Title text: "Export Products"; description: "Configure your export settings and download a CSV file of your products."
  - Invoked from `app/dashboard/supplier/products/page.tsx` via `showExportDrawer` state.

- [x] Export API route status
  - Exists: `app/api/products/export/route.ts` (GET)
  - Uses Supabase SSR client; requires authenticated user; roles allowed: Supplier, Admin.
  - Returns `text/csv` with `Content-Disposition: attachment` and template-compatible headers.

- [x] State management review (Export drawer)
  - Local state for filters (`selectedStatus`, `selectedCategory`, `selectedRegions`, `lowInventoryOnly`).
  - `handleExport`:
    - Simulates progress via `setInterval` and only triggers download when progress reaches 100.
    - Triggers download by creating an `<a>` element with `href="/api/products/export?..."` and `download=...`, then programmatically `.click()` after a delay.
    - No direct API call is made; relies on the browser to navigate/download when the timer completes.

- [x] Common failure points identified
  1) Download blocked due to missing user gesture
     - Many browsers block programmatic `a.click()` downloads initiated outside a user gesture (e.g., delayed by `setInterval`).
     - In this UI, the click happens seconds after the user pressed Export (i.e., not a direct gesture), so the browser may silently ignore the download.
  2) Drawer context/portal timing
     - The anchor is appended to `document.body` during drawer open with overlay; not typically an issue, but some blockers are stricter when not a gesture.
  3) Filters causing empty dataset
     - Even if dataset is empty, a CSV should still download with headers; this does not match "doesnâ€™t export" symptom.
  4) Auth/session
     - Route requires auth; if the session cookie isn't present, route returns 401. However, the same-page anchor request should include cookies. E2E spec verifies CSV returns under freeze.

- [x] Console/Network observations (static analysis)
  - No runtime console code present in the drawer for API errors.
  - Download is not using `fetch`; therefore, no caught errors are surfaced in the UI.
  - E2E: `tests/e2e/products/export-drawer.readonly.spec.ts` directly calls `/api/products/export?status=active` and asserts CSV headers; this indicates the API path and handler are correct.

- [x] CSV generation logic status
  - API composes rows with keys: `sku,title,description,image_urls,base_price,commission_pct,regions,inventory,active` using `csv-stringify/sync`.
  - Query filters: `category`, `status`, `search`, `regions` (array overlap on `region`). Suppliers see only rows where `supplier_id == user.id`.

- [x] Root cause (most likely)
  - The delayed, programmatic `link.click()` happens outside a user gesture, which is commonly blocked by modern browsers (e.g., Chrome) and results in no download.

- [x] Proposed fix (UI only; non-breaking)
  - Trigger the download directly within the button click handler (user gesture):
    - Option A: Immediately set `window.location.assign('/api/products/export?...')` to initiate download (navigation will not block). Show a non-blocking progress UI if desired.
    - Option B: Perform `fetch('/api/products/export?...', { credentials: 'include' })`, stream/Blob the response, create `URL.createObjectURL(blob)`, and programmatically click an `<a>` in the same user gesture call stack.
    - Option C: Use a hidden persistent anchor ref with `download` attribute and set its `href` then `.click()` synchronously from the button handler.
    - Implemented: Immediate hidden anchor click within the handler, followed by cosmetic progress.
  - Keep the progress bar as cosmetic if no real streaming progress is available.

- [x] Next steps to validate
  1. Modify `handleExport` to trigger the download synchronously from the button click (do not wait on `setInterval`).
  2. Optionally keep the visual progress after triggering download; stop trying to click the link later.
  3. Verify under both `CORE_FREEZE=true` and `SHOPS_FREEZE=true` (GET is allowed) and with both Supplier/Admin roles.
  4. Confirm CSV downloads and contains expected rows; confirm no console errors.

## Post-fix verification checklist

- [x] Build succeeds: `pnpm build`
- [ ] Sign in as Supplier
- [ ] Visit `/dashboard/supplier/products`
- [ ] Open Export drawer and select filters (Active, All, KR)
- [ ] Click Export in modal
- [ ] CSV downloads immediately
- [ ] Cosmetic progress animation shows
- [ ] Drawer auto-closes after completion
- [ ] Open CSV file - contains data
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Test with different filters
- [ ] Works in Chrome, Firefox, Safari

## Results

- Download works: [YES/NO]
- CSV contains data: [YES/NO]
- Console errors: [list]
- Tested browsers: [list]
