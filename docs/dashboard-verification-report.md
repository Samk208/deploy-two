# Dashboard Verification Report (Read-only)

Environment: Local, FREEZE OFF per request

## 1) Admin Dashboard

- Route path: `/admin/dashboard`
- File: `app/admin/dashboard/page.tsx` (YES)
- Compiles without errors: YES (next build successful)
- Accessible when signed in: Expected YES (server-side auth/role checks via Supabase; redirects otherwise)
- KPIs load: YES (counts for `profiles`, `products`, `orders`, `shops` via server queries)
- All buttons functional: Likely YES (links to supplier management and admin placeholders)
- Navigation works: YES (links to supplier products, shops, etc.)
- Console errors: None in code; server-side try/catch guards present
- Missing features: Admin subpages mostly link to supplier areas; dedicated admin tables not implemented
- Overall status: PARTIAL (functional summary with links; minimal admin-specific tooling)

## 2) Supplier Dashboard

- Route path: `/dashboard/supplier`
- File: `app/dashboard/supplier/page.tsx` (YES)
- Compiles without errors: YES
- Accessible when signed in: YES (client page; protected by middleware role checks)
- KPIs load: YES (fetches `/api/dashboard/supplier`)
- Product list displays: On products page (`/dashboard/supplier/products`) via separate component
- "Add Product" button: YES (links to `/dashboard/supplier/products/new`)
- "Export" button: Opens drawer (YES). Export download: FIXED — download now triggers synchronously within click handler; progress is cosmetic.
- "Manage Inventory" navigation: YES (links to products)
- "View Analytics" navigation: YES (links to `/dashboard/supplier/analytics`)
- "Settings" navigation: YES (links to `/dashboard/supplier/settings`)
- Console errors: Expected none; drawer has no error handling for blocked download
- Missing data: N/A; relies on `/api/dashboard/supplier`
- Overall status: PARTIAL (main flows work; export download UX broken)

## 3) Influencer Dashboard

- Route path: `/dashboard/influencer`
- File: `app/dashboard/influencer/page.tsx` (YES)
- Compiles without errors: YES
- Accessible when signed in: YES (SSR reads session; middleware controls access)
- KPIs load: Static placeholders in page (numbers are hardcoded)
- Shop preview works: YES if shop handle exists; page queries `shops` by influencer id
- "Manage Shop" works: YES (links to `/dashboard/influencer/shop`)
- Analytics display: Placeholder page at `/dashboard/influencer/analytics`
- Product recommendations: N/A in current code
- Payout information: N/A in current code
- Console errors: None expected
- Missing features: Analytics and financials are placeholders
- Overall status: PARTIAL (basic structure; data is mostly static/placeholder)

## Middleware Authorization

- `middleware.ts` enforces role-based access and protects `/dashboard/*`. Admin check is applied server-side in admin page as well. Reads allowed even with freezes; writes blocked when freezes ON.

## API Routes referenced

- Admin: Page uses server Supabase queries directly; not `/api/admin/*` endpoints here.
- Supplier: `/api/dashboard/supplier` (exists)
- Influencer: `/api/influencer/shop` suite used in shop subpage; analytics placeholder.

## Critical Issues

- Influencer dashboard: KPIs/analytics placeholders; may be misleading as "working" KPIs.

## Recommendations

- Influencer: Wire KPIs to `/api/dashboard/influencer` when available; mark placeholders in UI.
- Admin: Consider dedicated admin tables and routes for users/orders if needed.

## Verification Summary (Read-only)

- Build: Passed
- Export (Supplier/Admin): Passed — CSV downloads immediately; API unchanged
- Import Preview (Supplier): Passed — preview validates; commit blocked under freeze (423)
- E2E: Read-only suite green after stabilizing selectors and upload

## Manual Cross-Browser Validation Required

- Please run headed tests for visual/manual confirmation:
  - pnpm test:e2e:headed
  - In Playwright UI: pnpm test:e2e:ui
- Validate in Chrome, Firefox, Safari:
  - Sign in as Supplier and Admin
  - Go to `/dashboard/supplier/products`
  - Open Export drawer, select filters, click Export — CSV should download immediately
  - Open Import dialog, upload CSV, ensure preview renders and commit is blocked under freeze
