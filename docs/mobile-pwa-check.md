# Mobile/PWA Check

- Manifest.json status: Not found
- Meta tags (viewport/theme-color): Not explicitly present in app/layout.tsx head
- Service worker: Not configured (no sw.js or next-pwa)
- Responsive design: Tailwind responsive classes detected across 70+ files; header/nav mobile breakpoints in place
- Mobile-specific issues: None blocking detected via static scan
- PWA installability: Not configured
- Offline support: Not present
- Recommendations:
  - Add viewport and theme-color meta tags
  - Add manifest.json with icons
  - Consider next-pwa or a simple service worker if offline support is desired
